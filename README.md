# cljs-boilerplate

ALPHA

An attempt to bring together the best practices of Clojure, ClojureScript, HTML5
Boilerplate, and Google Closure.  The end goal is an environment for quick
development (eg no manual compiling) and an efficient production deploy (eg
mimification and advanced cljs compiling).

## Usage

Much of the setup is currently manual.  Read
https://github.com/maxweber/cljs-devmode to understand how to setup auto
compilation of cljs scripts.  Read
http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/#Build-script to understand how to setup
compilation of the templates.
