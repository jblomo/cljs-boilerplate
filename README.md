# cljs-boilerplate

BETA

An attempt to bring together the best practices of Clojure, ClojureScript, HTML5
Boilerplate, and Google Closure.  The end goal is an environment for quick
development (eg no manual compiling) and an efficient production deploy (eg
mimification and advanced cljs compiling).

## Demo

Hopefully the demo is up at http://cljs-boilerplate.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Usage

Not all dependencies are uploaded to clojars, so if lein/maven complains check
github for the latest version.

To run in development mode:

* def `settings/*dev-mode*` true
* `lein ring server &`

To run in production mode:

* def `settings/*dev-mode*` false
* `cd build && ant`
* `LEIN_NO_DEV=true lein ring server   # for testing`
* `lein beanstalk deploy production || lein ring uberwar`
